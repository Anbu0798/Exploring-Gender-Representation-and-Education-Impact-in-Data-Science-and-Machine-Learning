# Exploring Gender Representation and Education Impact in Data Science and Machine Learning

This project focuses on exploring the representation of women in Data Science and Machine Learning, alongside investigating the impact of education on income levels. Utilizing a comprehensive survey dataset comprising 15,391 entries and 369 features, exploratory data analysis techniques are employed to examine relationships between various factors such as education, coding experience, current roles, and yearly compensation. Key analyses include evaluating mean salaries across different educational levels, programming experience levels, and current roles, revealing significant disparities in income levels based on gender and education. Statistical tests, including two-sample t-tests and bootstrapping, are conducted to validate these observations. Findings underscore the gender wage gap and the correlation between higher education levels and increased salaries within the field. The project outcomes provide valuable insights for understanding and addressing inequalities in the Data Science and Machine Learning domains.
